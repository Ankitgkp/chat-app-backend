# Security Setup for MongoDB Connection

## Important Security Notice

This repository has been updated to remove hardcoded MongoDB credentials from the source code.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your actual MongoDB connection string:
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your_username:your_password@your_cluster.mongodb.net/your_database_name
   PORT=3001
   ```

### 2. Security Best Practices

- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
- **Use strong passwords** for your MongoDB user
- **Rotate credentials regularly**
- **Use environment-specific credentials** for different deployments

### 3. Deployment

For production deployments:
- Set environment variables in your hosting platform (Heroku, Vercel, Railway, etc.)
- Never expose credentials in your source code
- Use secrets management in production environments

### 4. What Was Fixed

- ❌ **Before**: MongoDB credentials were hardcoded in `index.js`
- ✅ **After**: Credentials are loaded from environment variables only
- ✅ **Added**: Proper error handling if MONGODB_URI is not set
- ✅ **Added**: `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

## Previous Security Issue

The original code contained:
```javascript
// SECURITY RISK - DON'T DO THIS!
const mongoUri = process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database';
```

This has been replaced with secure environment variable handling.
